# Data-professional-survey-breakdown
This report cuts across the programmer's reaction towards their job, motivation level and their residence.

## Project overview

This Data Analytics project aims to provide insights into programmer's motivation and worklife balance in their various job role and country of residence. By analysing various aspects of the job role data,we seek to identify trends, and gain deeper understanding of most used programming language and how programmers are happy with their company's work life balance policy.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation 

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following task:
1. Data Loading and inspection.

From the image above, i had to click on transform so that i can inspect and remove un wanted data from the power query environment, before loading it to the powerBi environment.

3. Handling Missing Values by deleting unneeded columns and roles.

4. Data Cleaning and formatting by using appropriate data type and figures.

Using the Split By Column to remove unwanted characters.

The Image above is the Yearly range of Salary, from the two values given, i will create a new column called average yearly salary by firstly detaching every iphen and letter from the values to make calculation easier.


The image below is the result gotten after splitting the initial column, and deleting any other thing attached to the numbers like "K" and "K" column and iphen will be the next action to be taken.

After getting just the two values, its time to write formular to get the average value in a new column, see image below
